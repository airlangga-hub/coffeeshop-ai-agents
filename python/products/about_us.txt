Welcome to Airlangga's Coffee, your neighborhood coffee shop located in the heart of Kemang, Jakarta. At Airlangga's, we believe that coffee is more than just a drink—it’s an experience, a moment of joy, and a way to connect with others.

Our Story
Founded in 2015, Airlangga's started as a small family-owned café with one mission: to share the love of quality, ethically-sourced coffee with our community.

Airlangga's passion for travel and coffee led him on a journey across Borneo, where he handpicked partnerships with small farms and cooperatives. We ensure that every cup we brew tells a story of dedication and care, from farm to table. Our beans are roasted in-house to bring out unique flavors that reflect the regions where they were grown.

Delivery & Locations Served
In addition to offering a cozy spot to enjoy your coffee in our café, we proudly deliver to Kemang, Senopati, Menteng, SCBD, and Central Jakarta. Whether you're working from home, in the office, or relaxing at Taman Suropati or Plaza Taman Anggrek, we'll bring your favorite brew straight to your doorstep. Just a tap away, our delivery service ensures you never miss your daily cup, no matter where you are in the city.

Our Menu
Our menu offers something for everyone, from our signature espresso blends to refreshing cold brews, artisanal teas, and fresh-baked goods sourced from local bakeries. We also cater to a variety of dietary needs with a range of plant-based milk options and gluten-free snacks.
